YouQuery 🎥🔍

AI-Powered YouTube Transcript Question Answering System

YouQuery is an AI-driven application that allows users to ask natural language questions about YouTube videos and receive accurate, context-aware answers without watching the entire video. It leverages LLMs, embeddings, and semantic search to retrieve relevant information directly from video transcripts.

🚀 Key Features

🔗 Load YouTube video transcripts automatically

🧠 Semantic search using vector embeddings

🤖 Context-aware answers powered by Large Language Models

⚡ Fast and efficient query responses

📄 Automatic transcript chunking for better retrieval

🧩 Modular and extensible architecture

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit

LLM & Orchestration: LangChain

Vector Database: ChromaDB

Embeddings: OpenAI / compatible embedding models

Data Source: YouTube Transcript Loader
